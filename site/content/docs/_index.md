## scrum 

There are many issue tracking and "agile" tools in the wild. In many cases these tools are actually wild in one or more of the following ways:

- complexity  

- cost 

- ignorant simplicity 

- integration 

These tools usually sit further away from where the end result is happening in
code.


GitHub provides simple and lightweight Issue Tracking and Project Management but lacks useful reporting that helps a Scrum team inspect and adapt.

If you are already using GitHub why introduce cognitive complexity by having another tool for project management. Keep everything in one place - the code, the issues, the wiki, the reporting.
